# IDEAS

- enable comments/ratings on blogs

# Profile page
- page where users can make their own blogs
- user page which shows their customized profile, all countries that user has visited and a list of all their blogs

### Destinations
- interactive map to visually display locations (mapping libraries include "Leaflet", "Mapbox") to search for countries 
     and everything that you can do there.
     (perhaps copy same map to bucketlist page under user profile)
- page with "randomized destination" button which shows a random travel destination idea
     (use API call with any of: "OpenTripMap API", "REST Countries API", "Google Places API")


Leaflet API:

Finished login screen aesthetics.
Need to include login info in frontend (log isLoggedIn data)!!!
Added logout functionality.
Authentication is currently bugged. On refresh user get's logged out
     this is due to session id not being properly stored in frontend.

27-11-2023:
Tested backend again, seems fine, auth issue is between back-/frontend.
TODO next -> Handle data fetching in frontend, make sure session id gets stored correctly!!!

30-11-2023:
Solved backend-/-frontend issue regarding CORS, login and logout both work now.
Updated backend, added new tests, fixed blogposts class.
Frontend works, but needs conditional rendering!
(sessionid now gets stored correctly in Cookies!!!)

06-12-2023:
Satisfied with Contact page.
Starting brainstorming for Destinations and Profile page 
     (what API to use etc).
Started working on destinations and profile page backend viewsets.
     (For now, planning on creating hybrid functionality of local API aswell as implementing
     REST countries API).
Added update_countries.py file which fetches country data from the REST countries API.
Added OpenTripMap api in opentrip branch, instead going to implement REST countries in backend and  
     OpenTripMap in frontend as it takes up too much db space.

07-12-2023:
Started development of Profile.jsx component, implementing REST countries API aswell as other parameters.

08-12-2023:
Profile.jsx still incorrect, right now displays hardcoded profile instead of dynamically.

23-01-2024:
First time poking in at project again, tried overseeing bug in Profile.jsx with no luck.

29-01-2024:
Possibly found the profile.jsx bug, userId is possibly never passed along (as seen in Api.jsx) which means it should be specified first.`

04-02-2024:
Fixed profile.jsx bug in frontend and backend, profiles now load correctly according to logged in user. Bug lied in backend primarily
due to not loading the profiles correctly, used *args **kwargs to setup dynamic loading instead.

   - new bug surfaced in profile.jsx where profile pictures for some reason won't load eventhough path is correct and terminal
     aswell as console correctly show path to the profile pictures in the API (honestly lost on this one).
   - added new and improved TestCase for above mentioned view.

05-02-2024:
Decided to use Leaflet for the frontend map on user's profilepage in order to display countries and interests.
Made Modal.jsx component for rendering dynamic modal popups, integrated it within ProfileForm.jsx for textarea.

07-02-2024: 
Minor UX tweaks for profile page.
Fixed profile picture bug.
Alphabetically sorted localplace.

09-02-2024: 
Added profile backround component, made some stylistic changes.
Found profile_picture bug where on edit the profile picture sets itself to null for some reason.
Perhaps split profile and background picture updating to seperate component!!!
Added bio Modal popup.

12-02-2024:
Started restructuring of profile page where profile_picture and profile_background can be updated by clicking on them.

14-02-2024:
Restructured profile.jsx and added PictureEditor.jsx in order to individually edit profile_picture and profile_background.
Stylistic changes are mostly done for Profile.jsx, next up is implementing the Leaflet map.
Started with Destinations.jsx by implementing the Leaflet API.

Switching backend from REST countries to Leaflet. 
     -> Ran into some issues trying to migrate new model, might have to reset whole backend in order to integrate Leaflet instead of
     REST countries. command:      "python manage.py migrate travel zero"      WARN!!!! ONLY USE IF 100% SURE!!!!

     Otherwise remove the following:  "You can manually delete the rows causing the integrity error in the travel_userprofile_visited_countries table."

15-02-2024:
Removed REST countries from backend, migrated backend, lot of restructuring so code MIGHT be bugged in some places!!!!
Emptied db in order to migrate anew.
Tidied up frontend WorldMap code.
Created view specific for user profile for displaying interested and visited countries, will be integrated with Profile.jsx later.

16-02-2024:
Added ProfileMap component to Profile.jsx, now need to implement all features to it.
Discovered bug in Profile.jsx where on expansion of bio overflow-y is suddenly blocked. -> SOLVED
Map does not fully work, clicking on map currently does nothing. -> SOLVED
Fixing feature of adding visited and interested countries, need backend support.

17-02-2024:
ProfileMap bug fixed! Data now get's logged correctly to backend, and is in turn correctly displayed in the frontend map.
Encountered new bug where visited countries work as expected, but interested countries get logged in the same array for some reason,
     needs fixing.

18-02-2024:
Fixed bug, both interested and visited get added correctly now, DO NOT EDIT addToCountryList!!!!
