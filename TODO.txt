# IDEAS

- enable comments/ratings on blogs

# Profile page
- page where users can make their own blogs
- user page which shows their customized profile, all countries that user has visited and a list of all their blogs

### Destinations
- interactive map to visually display locations (mapping libraries include "Leaflet", "Mapbox") to search for countries 
     and everything that you can do there.
     (perhaps copy same map to bucketlist page under user profile)
- page with "randomized destination" button which shows a random travel destination idea
     (use API call with any of: "OpenTripMap API", "REST Countries API", "Google Places API")

Authentication is currently bugged. On refresh user get's logged out
     this is due to session id not being properly stored in frontend.

TODO next -> Handle data fetching in frontend, make sure session id gets stored correctly!!!

Setting up email messaging via Gmail.

06-12-2023:
Satisfied with Contact page.
Starting brainstorming for Destinations and Profile page 
     (what API to use etc).
Started working on destinations and profile page backend viewsets.
     (For now, planning on creating hybrid functionality of local API aswell as implementing
     REST countries API).
Added update_countries.py file which fetches country data from the REST countries API.
Added OpenTripMap api in opentrip branch, instead going to implement REST countries in backend and  
     OpenTripMap in frontend as it takes up too much db space.

07-12-2023:
Started development of Profile.jsx component, implementing REST countries API aswell as other parameters.

08-12-2023:
Profile.jsx still incorrect, right now displays hardcoded profile instead of dynamically.
