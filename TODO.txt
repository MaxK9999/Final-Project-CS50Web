# IDEAS

- enable comments/ratings on blogs

# Profile page
- page where users can make their own blogs
- user page which shows their customized profile, all countries that user has visited and a list of all their blogs

### Destinations
- interactive map to visually display locations (mapping libraries include "Leaflet", "Mapbox") to search for countries 
     and everything that you can do there.
     (perhaps copy same map to bucketlist page under user profile)
- page with "randomized destination" button which shows a random travel destination idea
     (use API call with any of: "OpenTripMap API", "REST Countries API", "Google Places API")
